### Mission Statement:

To replace traditional rating scale methods with a gamified approach for assessing Alzheimer's disease progression, providing diagnostic results to support clinical treatment.

Additionally, the software aims to enhance memory, attention, executive function, reaction speed, and visuospatial abilities in Alzheimer's patients through targeted cognitive exercises across various domains.

### Slogan:

**Safeguarding Cognition, Illuminating Golden Years**

### II. Product Architecture

Delivered as a web-based service, the primary functionality involves test subjects playing several cognitive training games followed by immediate assessment results.

The game design is based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a standardized tool for evaluating dementia severity. The MoCA assesses eight cognitive domains:
1. Visuospatial abilities
2. Naming
3. Memory
4. Attention
5. Language
6. Abstract reasoning
7. Delayed recall
8. Orientation

Our implementation maps these domains through specific games:

| Game Title         | MoCA Domain        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maze Navigation    | Visuospatial       | Award points for successfully navigating a maze from start to finish.     |
| Symbol Matching    | Naming             | Earn points by correctly matching images with corresponding text labels.  |
| Memory Grid        | Memory             | Score points through memorization and recall of grid contents.            |
| Tile Connection    | Attention          | Gain points by identifying matching pairs through connected pathways.     |
| Category Sorting   | Abstract Reasoning | Score points by classifying similar visual or textual content.            |
| Flip Card Match    | Delayed Recall     | Earn points through delayed recognition of previously shown visual/textual content. |
| Date Calculation   | Orientation        | Receive points for solving date-related orientation problems.             |

Post-assessment, users receive immediate results through radar charts and may choose to share these with family members for health monitoring purposes.
